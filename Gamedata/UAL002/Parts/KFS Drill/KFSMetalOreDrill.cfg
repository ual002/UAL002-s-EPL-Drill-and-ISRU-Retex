title = KFS Metal Ore Drill
manufacturer = Kienar Fleet Systems
description = Designed to help extract metal ores from the crust of planets and asteroids, the KSF Drill uses a rotary drill combined with an internal transfer auger to pull crushed regolith into holding tanks for later processing.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.
